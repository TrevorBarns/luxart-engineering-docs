{% hint style="info" %}
This resource utilizes [globbing](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/resource-manifest/resource-manifest/#globbing) which may not be supported in some linux environments. Most releases include `fxmanifest.for.Linux.Servers.no.globbing.zip` which contain a compatible fxmainfest.lua without globbing.
