#### &#x20;Streamed Custom Weapon

It is important to note that **restarting the resource** after players have spawned the weapon **will result in the players FiveM crashing**. If restarting the resource in the future is desired consider moving the weapon related elements (metas and stream folder) to a resource on their own.
