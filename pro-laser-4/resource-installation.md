#### &#x20;Streamed Weapon & Weapons Meta

If you stream vintage pistol or it's associated metas in another resource, Pro Laser 4 will conflict with them. You will need to replace these or change which model Pro Laser 4 uses.

#### Streamed Weapon Wheel Textures

If you stream custom weapon wheel textures in another resource and would like to use the custom lidar weapon image, you'll need to edit `weapons_dlc_bb.png` in the`UI` folder.
