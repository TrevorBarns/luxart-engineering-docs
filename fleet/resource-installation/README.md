{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
LVC utilizes a modified release of RageUI, please install it even if you already have an older version. This release should be backwards compatible, please report any issues and I can resolve them for you.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This resource utilizes [globbing](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/resource-manifest/resource-manifest/#globbing) which may not be supported in some linux environments. Most releases include `fxmanifest.for.Linux.Servers.no.globbing.zip` which contain a compatible fxmainfest.lua without globbing.
